With the power of knowledge, we can enable ourselves to provide the best experience to our fellow developers, and our stakeholders. One of the solutions that supplies this power is Application Insights. Application Insights is a service provided by Microsoft allowing you to monitor your application live, detect performance anomalies, and observe this data with powerful analytics. Together we will see how easy it is to add Application Insights to our applications, whether we have access to the codebase or not. Once instrumented, we will dive deeper into the capabilities of Application Insights and show how to leverage all the rich data collected from our application. Finally, as developers the last thing we want to do is troubleshoot an issue in Production, with everyone watching and the stakes are high. Watch as we monitor a live application that is throwing exceptions and how Application Insights can be used to help us solve the problem faster. When we are done, attendees will be empowered with the knowledge to leverage Application Insights to be more productive with their work.","banner":"images/cloud-with-chris-banner.png","image":"img/cloudwithchrislogo.png","youtube":"yFV4uBsH26M"},{"filename":"episode/weekly-vlog-020/","url":"http://localhost:1313/episode/weekly-vlog-020/","title":"V020 - Weekly Technology Vlog #20","description":"Welcome to weekly Vlog #20!

Or have you needed to collaborate on files with colleagues in some way? That's a common scenario for developers, infrastructure engineers or data scientists/developers. It's an increasingly common problem. Some people solve this using   file shares or FTP Servers with numerous files, v1, v2, v2-final, but that doesn't scale and is quite a messy approach. Surely there is a better way? That's where a Version Control System can really help you. One such option is Git. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that rather than relying on a central location to host and store the entire set of files and history, each machine has a full version of the codebase and history locally. This means each user can be productive locally and independently on their own machine. Git is also optimised to be very lightweight and perfomant.","banner":"images/banner.jpg","image":"images/cloud-drops-git-101.jpg","youtube":"4140Gtfp4-A"},{"filename":"episode/weekly-vlog-013/","url":"http://localhost:1313/episode/weekly-vlog-013/","title":"V013 - Weekly Technology Vlog #13 (Lots of Azure, DevOps & GitHub) Blogs, Quick-fire Azure Updates","description":"In this video, Chris provides an update on the Azure Blogs (lots of great updates this week), a quick-fire round of Azure Technology Updates, dives into the Azure DevOps Blog and GitHub Blogs.
