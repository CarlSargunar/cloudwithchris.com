Azure Arc extends the use of Azure Services beyond the Azure cloud. With Azure Arc you are able to deploy and monitor Azure services in your own datacentres or other cloud providers. This event will focus on Azure Application Services and how they can be deployed outside of Azure through Kubernetes with Azure Arc.

In this show you will learn:

* Quick overview of Azure Arc
* How to deploy your own API Management Gateway through Arc
* How to deploy APIs and Logic Apps to Kubernetes clusters
* How to monitor on-premise applications through Azure

This show is particularly suitable for Architects and Developers interested in application development and hybrid cloud approaches.
