Hello, and welcome back to Cloud with Chris! You're with me, Chris Reddington - and we'll be talking about all things Cloud! We're going to go in a little bit of a different direction for this episode,  and focus on the podcast itself and my podcast journey so far! As you'll know, I'm still early on this journey, so I do appreciate all of your support- Whether that is feedback to keep making the episodes more useful, liking or subscribing across social media or podcast channels, or suggesting topic ideas for future episodes! All of these can be found on the Podcast's website, [www.cloudwithchris.com](https://www.cloudwithchris.com).

Not only is this episode topic slightly different, we're running a different format as well! In this episode, I'm joined by my colleague, Fletcher Kelly - who is exploring the idea of setting up his own podcast! Instead of me being the interviewer , I'm the one who ends up in the hot seat and talk about my experience so far of setting up Cloud with Chris! Hopefully this will give you a little bit of an idea of my journey so far, and why I wanted to set the podcast up as well! So, let's go ahead and start the episode...

**TRANSCRIPT TBC**

There we go, something a little different to listen into on Cloud with Chris for this episode! If you'd like to hear a little bit more of what goes on behind the scenes, or about the journey that I'm on setting the podcast up, please let me know - as we can run more episodes like this in the future! 

I already have plans to dive a little bit deeper into the echnical side of how I got things going with Cloud with Chris. These range from how I host the website and the podcast audio, all the way through to my development process for the website itself and talking through how I integrate external services like Calendly and Office Forms into my workflow. Like many these days, time is a valuable asset. I look for opportunities to continue optimising, and potentially automating some of these tasks - to make my time on Cloud with Chris more effective.

So those will be some additional topics to look forward to in the future. In the meantime, I hope that you're keeping safe and well - and thank you once again for tuning in. Until next time, thank you - and good bye.
