Description: "Building and marinating a five 9s system isn't just about the tools and technologies. Development culture has a big part in how you keep a system available while scaling it up and supporting more features, users, and locations. A healthy learning culture, supporting the development, not repairing mistakes, and identifying weak points is another tool in the engineering toolbox. In this talk, Chris is joined by Amir Shaked who will explain how to create a learning culture using debriefs, what to avoid, and how to instil change in an engineering organization."

Building and marinating a five 9s system isn't just about the tools and technologies. Development culture has a big part in how you keep a system available while scaling it up and supporting more features, users, and locations.

A healthy learning culture, supporting the development, not repairing mistakes, and identifying weak points is another tool in the engineering toolbox.

In this talk, Chris is joined by Amir Shaked who will explain how to create a learning culture using debriefs, what to avoid, and how to instil change in an engineering organization.
