Hello, and welcome back to Cloud with Chris! You're with me, Chris Reddington - and we'll be talking about all things Cloud!

In this episode, we get back to a requirements based topic, and an area that will significantly impact the design of our resulting solution architecture. That topic is security! It's one of the hot topics that organisations want to discuss when moving to the cloud. So I'm pleased to be joined in this episode by another colleague, Andrew Nathan, who has a wealth of knowledge in the cyber security space. 

There's plenty to digest in this one, so let's waste no time and jump straight in. Here we go…

Well, we had quite the journey there - didn't we? We've learned that like other aspects of building our solution, requirements are vital when designing security into your approach. That idea of failing to plan is planning to fail.

Once we've begun threat modelling and have an idea of who and what our threats are, that's when we can begin working on security measures to reduce or mitigate that threat. There are Azure Services that can help us have visibility into what is actually happening in our system. Azure Security Center has a wealth of features, including secure score, that can help us baseline and measure our progress. There's also Azure Sentinel, where we can ingest a number of data sources to help us see and stop threats before they cause harm.

Finally, like most requirements, we learned, that our security requirements will continue to adjust over time. Evolving your security operations into a War Gaming style of working, where you have a Red Team which is trying to attack the system, and a blue team which is trying to detect or prevent attacks is a modern extension of your security practice.

Don't forget to subscribe to and follow Cloud with Chris on your podcast streaming platform of choice, YouTube and any social media channels that you use. We've left you with plenty to digest, so thank you once again for joining. Until next time… Goodbye!
