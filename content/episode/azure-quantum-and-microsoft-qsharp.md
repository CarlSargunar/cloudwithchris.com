Description: "You've probably heard about quantum computing, but it still remains a mystery? In this introductory session, I will explain important concepts like qubits, superposition and entanglement and how quantum computing can hopefully help us to solve exponentially large problems. Some theoretical knowledge about quantum physics, quantum gates and quantum algorithms will be combined with examples using a simulated environment on a local PC and on real quantum hardware using Azure Quantum. Most of these examples will use the new quantum language Q# from Microsoft and some additional examples will use Python to solve optimization problems using the Azure Quantum Inspired Optimization (QIO)."

You've probably heard about quantum computing, but it still remains a mystery? In this introductory session, I will explain important concepts like qubits, superposition and entanglement and how quantum computing can hopefully help us to solve exponentially large problems.

Some theoretical knowledge about quantum physics, quantum gates and quantum algorithms will be combined with examples using a simulated environment on a local PC and on real quantum hardware using Azure Quantum. Most of these examples will use the new quantum language Q# from Microsoft and some additional examples will use Python to solve optimization problems using the Azure Quantum Inspired Optimization (QIO).
