Hello and welcome back to Cloud with Chris! You're with me - Chris Reddington, and we'll be talking about all things cloud. Now, the backlog of episodes continues to look healthy, with a number of additional session ideas planned and a number of guests scheduled to come in. But, please do keep your thoughts coming in, and if you find these podcasts useful, please do continue to share - and I hope that we can grow the community that supports it!

Let's introduce the next episode -We have another guest! We're starting to bring a few of those previous topics together in this episode. We touch upon requirements, DevOps, and building applications - or rather APIs - in the cloud. In this episode, I talk with a colleague and friend, Peter Piper, on factors that relate and impact API design. So, without further ado… here we go!

** TBC - Needs to be transcribed **

There we go! Lots to take in there, thinking of different patterns and common approaches or pitfalls that have been encountered along the way in Peter's experience. Peter and I both continued chatting after we recorded the episode, and had so many ideas on where we could have expanded further, so we're sure that there will be a follow-up at some point in the future. On that point - If there's anything you'd like us to expand on, please do get in touch either on Twitter or Facebook, @CloudWithChris.Don't forget, CloudWithChris is on your favourite platforms - Spotify, iTunes, GooglePlayMusic, Stitcher, PocketCasts, YouTube and directly at www.cloudwithchris.com.
