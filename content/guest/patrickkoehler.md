Patrick started his IT career 13 years ago as a System Engineer in the field of server outsourcing and consultancy services. Now he's working as a Technical Leader with a specialization on Microsoft Azure and Windows Virtual Desktop and supports his clients to successfully modernize their IT infrastructure. Since the beginning of 2020, he started his own blog to share his knowledge in one of his favourite products, Windows Virtual Desktop. The blog can be reached by: [www.wvdlogix.net](www.wvdlogix.net).

Besides blogging, he is in the leading board of the largest WVD Community in the world, the [wvdcommunity.com](wvdcommunity.com). Together with Neil McLoughlin and Stefan Dingemanse, he's doing regular Podcasts, posts weekly newsletter and plan events around WVD and the partner ecosystem.

Patrick has been awarded with the very rare Azure Hero - Content Hero Badger in May 2020 for his contribution to the Azure community.
Additionally he has founded his own German Windows Virtual Desktop User Group and is organizing monthly meetups, which will be held virtually and physically.
