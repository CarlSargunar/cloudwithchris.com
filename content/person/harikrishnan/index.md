Polyglot Full Stack Developer, Architecture Consultant, XP Coach and Trainer, with over 16 years of experience. I have worked across multiple tech stacks and application architectures. My domain exposure includes investment banking, network security, telecommunications, logistics and retail. Apart from writing code I coach other developers, project managers and product owners. I advise organisations both large and small on transformation activities. I have spoken at PyCon Singapore, RubyConf India, Agile India, Devops Days and Garden City RubyConf.
