I'm CTO @Sintraconsulting and I worked as Senior Developer, Team Leader and architect in a very large set of enterprise projects. I had a master's degree in Robotic science and another master's degree in project management. My experience in technology extends on many technologies (java, PHP, .net) and platforms (Sharepoint, Liferay, Pimcore) other than techniques (Agile, DevOps, ALM). I’m also interested in Agile techniques, project management, and product development.

**The opensource experience**
My second life is about opensource. I started in 2006 with an IDE for CSS, and I founded a group of opensource developers called "arduosoft", because make opensource software in the spare time was arduous.
During the last 13 years, I created many opensource projects, most of them failed. This is a very big experience and teaches me how to start an opensource project and avoid it will fail. Nowadays you can find on my personal GitHub account ([https://github.com/zeppaman/](https://github.com/zeppaman/)) or into the Arduosoft organization account ([https://github.com/arduosoft](https://github.com/arduosoft)).

**My experience as speaker**
I'm writing about cloud transformation on most important Medium publications (The Startup, Better programming, Towards Data Science) and my profile is [https://medium.com/@daniele.fontani](https://medium.com/@daniele.fontani)

I write on the Codeproject community for 13 years and I’m now a member of the author’s group ([https://www.codeproject.com/Members/sir-zeppaman](https://www.codeproject.com/Members/sir-zeppaman)).
I’m one administrator of the meetup group TechItalia Tuscany that has the goal to link professionals and creates a network through technical meetings [https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/TechItaliaTuscany/](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/TechItaliaTuscany/)

I speak publicly once a month. I have spoken physically or virtually in many countries (Uk, Jamaica, Italy, Belarus) about DevOps, opensource, and cloud transformation.
